Title: Dictionary

Description:
Written in Python, this is a dictionary that you can add to, remove from, and read from. This was made as a test because I am starting to use GitKraken, and it is not meant to be taken as a full on project.

How to Install:
Download the main.py Python file and run it.

How to Use:
When you run the file, you will be prompted with multiple options.
-Read: Reads the entire dictionary.
-Check: Finds a specific word that you would like to see in the dictionary.
-Remove: Removes a specific word from the dictionary.
-Add: Adds a specific word to the dictionary along with a definition.
-Exit: Exits the program.
